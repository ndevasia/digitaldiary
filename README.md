Before installing:
- You need to be on Python 3.11 (I had some issues with 3.14).
- You'll need npm and pip working in your CLI.

Instructions:
- ```cd frontend && npm install && cd ..``` (this installs the frontend requirements and then returns to the root)
- ```pip install -r backend/requirements.txt``` (this installs the backend requirements; IGNORE the requirements.txt in root, it is probably out of date)
- ```npm run start``` builds the local version of the app. You can try it to see if the app window loads. However, to see media, you will need to contact me for the .env file.
